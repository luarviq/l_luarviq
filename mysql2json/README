 There are a pair of questions appearing when you face this library:
  
 1. Why JSON?

 Install:
 
 ruby setup.rb
 
 Use:
 
 This snippet of code will dump databases 'information_schema' and 'test' into 2 JSON files with appropriate names:
 >mysql2json=MySQL2JSON.new(:server=>'192.168.1.1',:password=>'my_password',:db_list=>['information_schema','test'])
 
 
 This snippet of code will dump an entire MySQL database into set of JSON files:
 >mysql2json=MySQL2JSON.new(:server=>'192.168.1.1',:password=>'my_password')
